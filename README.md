# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub!

As a tech professional with over a decade of experience spanning system monitoring, ITO service delivery, IT infrastructure, and field service engineering, I’ve developed a diverse skill set across multiple areas of IT.

Two years ago, I transitioned into software as an **Application Support Engineer**, where I strengthened my troubleshooting and problem-solving abilities. Now, I’m pursuing a **Software Development Bootcamp** to advance my career in software engineering and development.
